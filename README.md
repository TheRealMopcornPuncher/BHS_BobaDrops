# Boba!
Hey there! If you're reading this it means that you're one of the curious people that decided to look under the hood of OUR website! Neat!

Well, I won't bore you with any more flavor text. Here's our project structure:

### sitefiles
|
index.html
styles.css

### README.md (OMG IT'S ME!)

Super duper basic stuff right? Ik! It's meant to be! Only TWO whole files and BAM, an entire website. Take a look at index.html, this is the bare content of your page, things like text, buttons, headers, etc.
Now, an html file is pretty bare bones without it's counterpart of stylizing code: introducing... *drumroll please* CSS! An entire language made to make your HTML code look spicy.. or mellow, or lofi, cyberpunk, whatever you want!

So what are you waiting for? You know how this stuff works now, get to it!!! Make it your own and do something cool!
